Details--
Earl's Effervescent Emporium is a collection of small games themed around "bubbles" built for Global Game Jam 2025.

In [Bubble pop], Earl is weirdly against their ceiling being clean. Pop as many bubbles before they hit the top of the screen as you can! Just ten bubbles will put Earl so out of sorts that they'll end your game then and there.
